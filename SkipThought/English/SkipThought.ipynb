      "' (Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.     6) Is there any actual prejudice, not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly, to the respondent? The Minister directed the Court's attention to paragraphs [16]-[18] of the Full Court's decision in Iyer v Minister for Immigration a Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788 (' Iyer '), in which the Full Court canvassed relevant authorities on this issue. The appellant claimed her fear of persecution arose from the rapes. There was nothing in the independent evidence to satisfy the Tribunal that the [appellant] will be denied state protection for the reason of her ethnicity, religion or her membership of a particular social group of \"ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia\". The Full Court was absolving the Tribunal from any duty to engage in subtle teasing out of hypotheses that only abstrusely arise from an applicant's account of the circumstances that have led to the claim of refugee status. 45 In such circumstances, it behoved the Tribunal, in light of the several ways in which the appellant put her case, to examine whether the appellant might qualify for refugee status. 5. However, answering this question is influenced by the principle that:     'notwithstanding that real protection from persecution may be available elsewhere within the country of nationality, a person's fear of persecution in relation to that country will remain well-founded with respect to the country as a whole if, as a practical matter, the part of the country in which protection is available is not reasonably accessible to that person' (per Black CJ in Randhawa at 442). The decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal will be quashed. That, in turn, may in some cases make it necessary for the decision-maker to analyse what the appellant has said in terms of possible Convention categories.\n",

      "16 The Sharman applicants further submitted that the Full Court 'regularly' grants leave to appeal where it can be shown that the exercise of a discretion has miscarried, and where that miscarriage in the exercise of a discretion involves an important question of principle, citing as authority Wong at [22]. There is considerable force in those submissions of the Music companies. Although s 24(1A) does not purport to qualify or limit the Court's discretion (see Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399 in the joint reasons for judgment of Sheppard, Burchett and Heerey JJ), the Courts have developed general principles which inform the exercise of the discretion to refuse or grant leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment. 15 The Sharman applicants submitted that Brilliant Digital was distinguishable from the present circumstances because in the former instance, the orders the subject of application for leave to appeal arose from an Anton Piller order that had already been executed, but in the present case, Ms Hemming was yet to be cross-examined and had not, as at the date of hearing of the application, sworn an affidavit for instance on behalf of Sharman Networks. 18 In support of those propositions of the Sharman applicants, I was taken to several authorities in the United Kingdom and Australia concerned with the making of orders for cross-examination on disclosure affidavits made in pursuit of compliance with a Mareva order. The transferee was to a person associated with [Ms Hemming]. The requirement of leave to appeal indicates, however, that substantial injustice requires something more than that the subject decision is incorrect, otherwise the criterion would be superfluous. The Sharman applicants postulated that the 'remark' made by Lindgren J at [13] of his Honour's reasons for judgment in Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 that '[Wilcox J] accepted [in the course of granting the Mareva relief on 22 March 2005] that the Sharman Companies were controlled by Ms Hemming by reason of a \"client services agreement\" between her and TIL dated 8 April 2002' was an 'unsure foundation for any finding of control of the Sharman trust or the Sharman companies [by Ms Hemming]', and was thus inappropriately or impermissibly relied upon by Moore J in formulating his reasons for judgment. Ms Hemming was the Chief Executive Officer of the Sharman Companies. '     I am unable however to comprehend why Sharman License's subsidiary status in relation to Sharman Networks should exclude it from the operation of the order of the Court below, which understandably was so framed as to extend to 'any wholly owned subsidiary. One was whether the fourth respondent has a beneficial interest in the Sharman trust or at least has an interest which should have been identified in her disclosure affidavit.\n"
